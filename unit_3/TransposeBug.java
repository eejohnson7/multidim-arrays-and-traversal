/*
 * In this lesson, you'll be taking on the role of a developer working on improving a reservation system at a 
 * tech-savvy restaurant. The restaurant utilizes digital seating charts to plan out their table arrangements, 
 * which are represented by 2D arrays. Your objective is to correct a slight error in the function transposeSeating 
 * that's meant to rearrange the restaurant’s seating layout by transposing the seating chart. Unfortunately, the matrix 
 * transposition isn't working correctly. Inspect the Java code carefully and adjust it to ensure it correctly transposes 
 * the matrix.
